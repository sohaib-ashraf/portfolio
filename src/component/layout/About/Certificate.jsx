      How it started
    </h4>
     <p>
     During my education career When I was in 10th class I started working online and learned different programming languages and started a Job in a private forum. I complete my first project at the age of 17. After that, I’ve started freelancing officially along with my education. Now Alhamdulillah I’ve direct Clients but also do freelancing sometimes on Upwork, Fiverr, PPH and etc.     </p>
